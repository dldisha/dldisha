About me,
- 👋 Hi, I’m Disha. I can make machines predict the future by connecting dots from the past 👀👾
- 📍 I'm currently in NYC🗽(loving it).
- 🌱 And have recently graduated 🤓 with a Master in Computer Engineering from New York University💜

Apart from work, 
- 🧗🏽 I recently hiked over the Appalachian Trail (Stairway to Heaven) - June 2023.
- ⭐ Currently, I'm watching the Manifest TV series.
- 🌍 And planning my Iceland trip for next year.

💃 My Latest Adventure, 
- 🛩️ Skydiving in Dubai (Jan 2023) - a breathtaking journey from 13,000 feet, hurtling through the air at an astonishing speed of 120 miles per hour🤩. 

<br>
